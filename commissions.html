            <h1><u>Commissions</u></h1>
            <p>
                Here you will found some info about how my commissions work.<br>
                Prices can be negociated according to the work details and complexity.<br>
                I only accept payments via Fiverr, Ko-fi or PayPal<br>
                Discord: gamerpablito<br><br>
                The aproximated prices for FNF working would be the following:
            </p>
            <hr>
            <table id="services">
                <tr>
                    <th><u>Service</u></th>
                    <th><u>Description</u></th>
                    <th><u>Price</u></th>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br><hr>
            <h2><u>Terms of Service</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In case you're wondering, I only use Psych Engine when coding for mods</li>
                <li>I'm allowed to deny ANY commission, if I denied your commission before and you keep insisting, things will turn out so bad :\</li>
                <li>DON'T be rude if I'm not working as you expect, I'm doing my best to fulfill your expectations</li>
                <li>DON'T push me and/or ask me for updates so frequently; I have more projects, mods, and life stuff I must take care of too</li>
                <li>
                    Just want to make this clear, if you want me to do the job before a certain deadline and you got all the assets ready for me to start,
                    pls use Fiverr (contact me through there), otherwise use Ko-fi or PayPal (contact me via Discord), this in order to avoid future
                    inconveniences.
                </li>
                <li>In case you make the payment BEFORE the service, I can give you refunds in a lapse of 5 days since the payment day</li>
                <li>In case you make the payment AFTER the service, there's NO refunds, so make sure if the service I made is enough for you before send the payment</li>
                <li>
                    You can also make the payment by parts (you pay me partially when I complete a part of the job, NO refunds) or half-and-half (a half when
                    starting and a half when finishing, refunds available BEFORE paying the 2nd half)
                </li>
            </ol>
