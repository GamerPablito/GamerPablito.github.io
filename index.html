            <p>
                Hello there, I'm a 17-year-old coder (geek) who likes to play a lot with codes of every kind.<br>
                I'm used to code in Haxe, Java, SVG, HTML, C language (kind of), and sometimes Batch files I<br>
                make by my own when I'm bored hehe.<br><br>

                I'm also the main coder for a whole lot of mods in progress, and for the
                <a href="https://twitter.com/FNMCrpg">FNMC RPG</a> game that's<br>
                being worked so hard actually.<br><br>

                I've also made a brand new <a href="https://github.com/GamerPablito/HaxeGJClient">GameJolt Client for FNF</a>
                taking inspiration from the original<br>(and deprecated) adaptation made by <a href="https://github.com/TentaRJ">TentaRJ</a>
                for <a href="https://github.com/brightfyregit/Indie-Cross-Public">Indie Cross</a><br><br>
